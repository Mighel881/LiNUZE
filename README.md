# Which adapter do I need for devices with Ligtning connectors?

Honestly, most "USB3" lightning to USB-A adapters *should* work just fine. I'll list the two adapters that I used and confirmed to be working with LiNUZE. This is **NOT** a free advertisement for these products. I'm just sharing the experience.

### Apple's lightning to USB camera adapter
Probably the most popular one you'll find. I haven't tried the "USB 3" version of this adapter, but it should work fine.
Common issues I've encountered with this adapter is that sometimes iOS refuses to power the connected device, and you'll get an alert like this:
I was able to bypass this by using a dollar USB-A splitter, that probably reduced the consumed wattage of the connected device. Still, I wouldn't recommend this one if you're looking for a stable experience with LiNUZE. [Product link](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD821AM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter)
<h3>Any other USB 3 certified adapter</h3>  
<p>Honestly, these are much better than what Apple offers. Browse AliExpress and search for the terms "lightning otg usb 3" and buy one with product reviews in mind. I would recommend keeping it simple and just getting a plain lightning to USB-A adapter, instead of janky HUBs that include HDMIs, SD Card readers, etc.</p>







I'll update this list as more and more users confirm
